# AddressBook
In my Grand Canyon University Java Certificate program, I spent months learning and practicing the basics of Java through the advanced pieces needed to make a full-stack application. In the second class we started our Contact Book that utilized reading and writing to a file, and Java logic. This application turned into our final group project that was connected to a MySQL database with many added features as shown in my forked repository "GreenDragonConsulting."
